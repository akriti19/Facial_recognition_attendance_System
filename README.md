# Facial_recognition_attendance_System
The main purpose of this project is to build a face recognition-based attendance monitoring
system for educational institution to enhance and upgrade the current attendance system into more efficient and
effective as compared to before. In this project, face databases will be created to
pump data into the recognizer algorithm. Then, during the attendance taking session, faces will be compared
against the database to seek for identity. When an individual is identified, its attendance will be taken down
automatically saving necessary information into an excel sheet.

Create a DATASET of the student by entering his ID Number.
- Train the dataset, ayml file is created.
- A picture of the class is taken, and the RECOGNIZER python file is initiated.
- Attendance is taken by cropping the faces in the picture and comparing with the faces in the database.
- If a face is matched, the responding name with PRESENT status is marked in aEXCEL file with the current
date and time.
